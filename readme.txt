Turbolinks extracted from Rails, for use with WordPress.

== Description ==

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is awesome. There are a lot of plugins that let you do Markdown on your WordPress site.

There is, however, a shocking lack of plugins that force you to use Markdown in your content.

This plugin aims to fill that gap.

There are probably a lot of bugs. Please report them!
