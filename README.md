# Markdown Only, Please!

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is awesome. There are a lot of plugins that let you do Markdown on your WordPress site.

There is, however, a shocking lack of plugins that force you to use Markdown in your content. This plugin aims to fill that gap.

HTML is ugly, it's cludgy, it's messy. We don't want that in the database! No more!

There are probably a lot of bugs. Please report them!
